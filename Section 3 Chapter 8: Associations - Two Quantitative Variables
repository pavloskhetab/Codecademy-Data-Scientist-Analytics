TWO QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES

Introduction
When associations exist between variables, it means that information about the value of one variable gives us 
information about the value of the other variable. In this lesson, we will cover ways of examining an association 
between two quantitative variables.

Throughout the next few exercises, we’ll examine some data about Texas housing rentals on Craigslist — an online 
classifieds site. The data dictionary is as follows:

price: monthly rental price in U.S.D.
type: type of housing (eg., 'apartment', 'house', 'condo', etc.)
sqfeet: housing area, in square feet
beds: number of beds
baths: number of baths
lat: latitude
long: longitude
Except for type, all of these variables are quantitative. Which pairs of variables do you think might be associated? 
For example, does knowing something about price give you any information about square footage?
