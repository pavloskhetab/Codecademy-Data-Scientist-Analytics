In this project, you’ll analyze data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) and explore possible associations.

This data was originally sourced from 538’s Analysis of the Complete History Of The NBA and 
contains the original, unmodified data from Basketball Reference as well as several 
additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis.

You can read more about the data and how it’s being used by 538 here. 
For this project we’ve limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, 
point_diff, the difference between pts and opp_pts).

You will create several charts and tables in this project, so you’ll need to use plt.clf() 
between plots in your code so that the plots don’t layer on top of one another.

Let’s get started!

Setup Instructions
You have two options of completing this assignment. Either here, in the Codecademy Learning Environment, 
or on your own using a Jupyter notebook.

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, 
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below and then 
opening Codecademy_NBA_Trends_Project.ipynb and checking off your Tasks here. 
If you get stuck, you can look at Codecademy_NBA_Trends_Project_Solution.ipynb.
