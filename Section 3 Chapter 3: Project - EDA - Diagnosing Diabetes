EDA: Diagnosing Diabetes
In this project, you’ll imagine you are a data scientist interested in exploring data that looks at 
how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients.

You will use your EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.

Note: This dataset is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains the following columns:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
BMI: Body mass index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Let’s get started!

Setup Instructions
You have two options of completing this assignment. Either here, within Codecademy’s output terminal, or on your own, 
in case you’re more comfortable using a Jupyter notebook.If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, 
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. If you need help setting up your computer, be sure to check out our setup guides:

Code:
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
