Assessing Variable Types
“It all began with a variable”, the storyteller began.

Just kidding, no one starts their stories that way, even though variables are where all data stories begin.

Variables define datasets. They are the characteristics or attributes that we evaluate during data collection. 
There are two ways to do that evaluation: we can measure or we can categorize.

How we evaluate determines what kind of variable we have. Since there are only two ways to get data, 
there are only two types of variables: numerical and categorical.

A box labeled "Variables" points to two boxes below labeled "Categorical" and "Quantitative"

Every observation (the individuals or objects we are collecting data about) is classified according to its 
characteristics. In “flat” file formats (like tables, csvs, or DataFrames), the observations are the rows, 
the variables are the columns, and the values are at the intersection.

We’ll go deeper into categorical and numerical variables in the following exercises.

Typically, the best way to understand your data is to look at a sample of it.

In the example dataset about cereal below, we can look at the first few rows with the .head() 
method to get an idea of the variable types that we have.

print(cereal.head())

id	name	mfr	type	fiber	rating	shelf	vitamins	coupons	price
0	22341	100% Bran…	Nestle	C	10.0	68.40	top	25	4	3.46
1	22791	100% Natur…	Quaker Oats	C	2.0	33.98	top	0	1	3.36
2	98141	All-Bran…	Kelloggs	C	9.0	59.43	top	25	4	2.07
3	20001	All-Bran w…	Kelloggs	C	14.0	93.70	top	25	3	3.57
4	67121	Almond Del…	Ralston P..	C	1.0	34.38	top	25	1	5.21

There are several types of variables. For example:

The price column describes how much the cereal costs. We don’t know if that’s how much 
the consumer pays or the grocer pays, but we can be fairly sure that it’s a numerical variable.

In the mfr column, there are labels like Nestle, Quaker Oats, and Kelloggs, which seem like brands. 
Since brands are categories, mfr is most likely a categorical variable.

The id column also has numbers, but we can assume that since it’s the id, it’s not actually representing a value. 
It’s probably the label for the observation. Since it’s a label, even though it’s a number, 
id is a categorical variable.

If we were downloading this from a data repository, we would expect a data dictionary to define these 
variables and validate (or invalidate) our assumptions.

It is still important to inspect our dataset because it gives us a better understanding of the data 
that we are working with and the kinds of operations that will be possible.

Let’s practice inspecting a dataset to identify its variable types.

This dataset is a modified version of this Netflix data. The est_budget (USD) and cast_count variables 
were created for illustration purposes.

Code:
import codecademylib3

# Import pandas with alias
import pandas as pd

# Import dataset as a Pandas dataframe
movies = pd.read_csv("netflix_movies.csv", index_col=0)

# View the first five rows of the dataframe
print(movies.head())

# Set the correct value for rating_variable_type
rating_variable_type = 'categorical'
print(rating_variable_type)



Categorical Variables
Without getting too philosophical about it, “your mind is a categorization machine” - HBR. 
We move through the world by categorizing things into various groups: safe/unsafe, best/worst, on/off. 
These categorizations help us process information. They also create major problems for us when we over-categorize, 
and can lead to bias and unfair assumptions.

However, we still do it, and regardless of the dangers, categorization helps us transform 
the world around us into data. (Being aware of the dangers is a crucial part of data analysis, 
but outside the scope of this lesson.)

Categorical variables come in 3 types:

Nominal variables, which describe something,
Ordinal variables, which have an inherent ranking, and
Binary variables, which have only two possible variations.
one box with 'Nominal variables' written in it and 3 boxes blow it with 'Nominal', 'Ordinal', 
and 'Binary' below, illustrating the relationship between each of these types of variables and nominal variables.

Let’s look at each one separately

Nominal Variables
When we want to describe something about the world, we need a nominal variable. 
Nominal variables are usually words (i.e., red, yellow, blue or hot, cold), 
but they can also be numbers (i.e., zip codes or user id’s).

Often, nominal variables describe something with a lot of variation. 
It can be hard to capture all of that variation, so an ‘Other’ category is often necessary. 
For example, in the case of color, we could have a lot of different labels, 
but might still need an ‘Other’ category to capture anything we missed.

Ordinal variables
When our categories have an inherent order, we need an ordinal variable. 
Ordinal variables are usually described by numbers like 1st, 2nd, 3rd. 
Places in a race, grades in school, and the scales in survey responses (Likert Scales) are ordinal variables.

Ordinal variables can be a little tricky because even though they are numbers, 
it doesn’t make sense to do math on them. For example, let’s say an Olympian won a Gold medal (1st place) 
and a Bronze medal (3rd place). We wouldn’t say that they averaged Silver medals (2nd place).

Though there is some debate about whether Likert scales should be treated like intervals or ordinal categories, 
most statisticians agree that they are ordinal categories and therefore should not be summarized numerically.

Binary variables
When there are only two logically possible variations, we need a binary variable. 
Binary variables are things like on/off, yes/no, and TRUE/FALSE. If there is any possibility of a third option, 
it is not a binary variable.

Let’s take a look at our cereal dataset.

print(cereal.head())

id	name	mfr	type	fiber	rating	shelf	vitamins	coupons	price
0	22341	100% Bran…	Nestle	C	10.0	68.40	top	25	4	3.46
1	22791	100% Natur…	Quaker Oats	C	2.0	33.98	top	0	1	3.36
2	98141	All-Bran…	Kelloggs	C	9.0	59.43	top	25	4	2.07
3	20001	All-Bran w…	Kelloggs	C	14.0	93.70	top	25	3	3.57
4	67121	Almond Del…	Ralston P..	C	1.0	34.38	top	25	1	5.21

There are some obvious categorical variables: The name of the product, the mfr (manufacturer), 
and the shelf are all nominal categorical variables. We know this because they are written in descriptive 
words or letters.

A little less obvious is the type field. They are all ‘C’, which could be a ranking (A, B, C, and 
therefore an ordinal variable) or it could be a description and therefore a nominal variable. 
We would have to return to the data dictionary to find out for certain.

The id field may also cause confusion. It’s a number, but it’s not a count or a measurement. 
Rather, ‘id’ is a categorical variable since it is describing each observation in the same way that the name is.

Let’s go over our Netflix dataset to get a little more practice working with categorical variables.
