Sampling from a Population
In statistics, we often want to learn about a large population. Since collecting data for an entire population is often impossible, 
researchers may use a smaller sample of data to try to answer their questions.

To do this, a researcher might calculate a statistic such as mean or median for a sample of data. 
Then they can use that statistic as an estimate for the population value they really care about.

For example, suppose that a researcher wants to know the average weight of all Atlantic Salmon fish. 
It would be impossible to catch every single fish. Instead, the researchers might collect a sample of 50 fish off the coast of Nova Scotia and determine that the average weight of those fish is x. 
If the same researchers collected 50 new fish and took the new average weight, that average would likely be slightly different than the first sample average.

Over the course of this lesson, we will go over how we can extrapolate from sample data in order to describe our uncertainty about the statistics of the full population.



Random Sampling in Python
Now that we’ve generated some random samples from a population using an applet, let’s code this ourselves in Python. 
The numpy.random package has several functions that we could use to simulate random sampling. 
In this exercise, we’ll use the function np.random.choice(), which generates a sample of some size from a given array.

In the example code, we’ll pretend that we’re all-powerful and actually have a list of all the weights of Atlantic Salmon that currently exist.

In the example code to the right, we have done the following:

Loaded in the weights of all salmon into a dataframe called population.
Plotted the distribution of population and calculated the mean.
Used np.random.choice() function to generate a sample called sample of size 30 (samp_size variable is equal to 30).

Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import codecademylib3

population = pd.read_csv("salmon_population.csv")
population = np.array(population.Salmon_Weight)
pop_mean = round(np.mean(population),3)

## Plotting the Population Distribution
sns.histplot(population, stat='density')
plt.axvline(pop_mean,color='r',linestyle='dashed')
plt.title(f"Population Mean: {pop_mean}")
plt.xlabel("Weight (lbs)")
plt.show()
plt.clf() # close this plot

samp_size = 10
# Generate our random sample below
sample = np.random.choice(np.array(population), samp_size, replace = False)

### Define sample mean below
sample_mean = round(np.mean(sample), 3)

### Uncomment the lines below to plot the sample data:
sns.histplot(sample, stat='density')
plt.axvline(sample_mean,color='r',linestyle='dashed')
plt.title(F"Sample Mean: {sample_mean}")
plt.xlabel("Weight (lbs)")
plt.show()



Sampling Distributions
As we saw in the last example, each time we sample from a population, we will get a slightly different sample mean. 
In order to understand how much variation we can expect in those sample means, we can do the following:

Take a bunch of random samples of fish, each of the same size (50 fish in this example)
Calculate the sample mean for each one
Plot a histogram of all the sample means
This process gives us an estimate of the sampling distribution of the mean for a sample size of 50 fish.

The code to accomplish this is shown below:

salmon_population = population['Salmon_Weight']

sample_size = 50
sample_means = []

# loop 500 times to get 500 random sample means
for i in range(500):
  # take a sample from the data:
  samp = np.random.choice(salmon_population, sample_size, replace = False)
  # calculate the mean of this sample:
  this_sample_mean = np.mean(samp)
  # append this sample mean to a list of sample means
  sample_means.append(this_sample_mean)

# plot all the sample means to show the sampling distribution
sns.histplot(sample_means, stat='density')
plt.title("Sampling Distribution of the Mean")
plt.show()

The distribution of the sample_means looks like this:

This is a sampling distribution with a sample of 500. The distribution is centered around x=60 and looks fairly symmetrical.

Note that we can look at a sampling distribution for any statistic. 
For example, we could estimate the sampling distribution of the maximum by calculating the maximum of each sample, rather than the mean (as shown above).

Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import codecademylib3

population = pd.read_csv("cod_population.csv")
# Save transaction times to a separate numpy array
population = population['Cod_Weight']

sample_size = 50
sample_means = []

for i in range(500):
  samp = np.random.choice(population, sample_size, replace = False)
  this_sample_mean = np.mean(samp)
  sample_means.append(this_sample_mean)

sns.histplot(sample_means,stat='density')
plt.title("Sampling Distribution of the Mean")
plt.xlabel("Weight (lbs)")
plt.show()



Central Limit Theorem
So far, we’ve defined the term sampling distribution and shown how we can simulate an approximated sampling distribution for a few different statistics (mean, maximum, variance, etc.). 
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) allows us to specifically describe the sampling distribution of the mean.

The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed as long as the population is not too skewed or the sample size is large enough. 
Using a sample size of n > 30 is usually a good rule of thumb, regardless of what the distribution of the population is like. 
If the distribution of the population is normal, the sample size can be smaller than that.

Let’s take another look at the salmon weight to see how the CLT applies here. The first plot below shows the population distribution. 
The salmon weight is skewed right, meaning the tail of the distribution is longer on the right than on the left.

This graph shows the distribution of salmon weights across the entire population. The distribution is right-skewed as it ranges from 0 to almost 300 pounds.

Next, we’ve simulated a sampling distribution of the mean (using a sample size of 100) and super-imposed a normal distribution on top of it. 
Note how the estimated sampling distribution follows the normal curve almost perfectly.

This graph shows the sampling distribution of salmon weights across a sample size of 50. 
The sampling distribution is approximately normal, despite the population distribution being right-skewed, showcasing one of the key ideas behind the central limit theorem.

Note that the CLT only applies to the sampling distribution of the mean and not other statistics like maximum, minimum, and variance!

Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import seaborn as sns
import codecademylib3

cod_population = pd.read_csv("cod_population.csv")
# Save transaction times to a separate numpy array
population = cod_population['Cod_Weight']

## Checkpoint 1:
sns.histplot(population, stat = 'density' )
plt.title("Population Distribution")
plt.show()

sample_means = []

# Below is our sample size
samp_size = 50

for i in range(500):
    samp = np.random.choice(population, samp_size, replace = False)
    this_sample_mean = np.mean(samp)
    sample_means.append(this_sample_mean)

## Checkpoint 2
plt.clf() # this closes the previous plot
sns.histplot(sample_means, stat = 'density' )
plt.title("Sampling Distribution of the Mean")
plt.xlabel("Weight (lbs)")
plt.show()
