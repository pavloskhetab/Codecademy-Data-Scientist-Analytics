RULES OF PROBABILITY
Introduction
Probability is a way to quantify uncertainty. When we flip a fair coin, we say that there is a 50 percent chance (probability = 0.5) of it coming up tails. 
This means that if we flip INFINITELY many fair coins, half of them will come up tails. 
Similarly, when we roll a six-sided die, we say there is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a five.

What if we flip a coin in one hand and roll a die in the other at the same time. What is the probability that the coin comes up tails AND the die comes up as a five? 
Is there a way to quantify the probability that these two different events BOTH occur? 
In this lesson, we will walk through different rules of probability that help us quantify the probability of multiple random events.



Union, Intersection, and Complement
Let’s dive into some key concepts we will use throughout this lesson: union, intersection, and complement.

Union
The union of two sets encompasses any element that exists in either one or both of them. We can represent this visually as a Venn diagram.

A Venn diagram that shows two overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. Both of these circles are shaded blue.

For example, let’s say we have two sets, A and B. A represents rolling an odd number with a six-sided die (the set {1, 3, 5}). 
B represents rolling a number greater than two (the set {3, 4, 5, 6}). The union of these two sets would be everything in either set A, set B, or both: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}. 
We can write the union of two events mathematically as (A or B).

Intersection
The intersection of two sets encompasses any element that exists in both of the sets. Visually:

A Venn diagram that shows two overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. Only the overlap of the two circles is shaded.

The intersection of the above sets (A represents rolling an odd number on a six-sided die and B represents rolling a number greater than two) includes any value that appears in both sets: {3, 5}. 
We can write the intersection of two events mathematically as (A and B).

Complement
Lastly, the complement of a set consists of all possible outcomes outside of the set. Visually:

A Venn diagram that shows a circle representing event A. Everything outside of event A is shaded blue.

Consider set A from the above example (rolling an odd number on a 6-sided die). The complement of this set would be rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6}. 
We can write the complement of set A as AC. One key feature of complements is that a set and its complement cover the entire sample space. 
In this die roll example, the set of even numbers and odd numbers would cover all possible rolls: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.



Independence and Dependence
Imagine that we flip a fair coin 5 times and get 5 heads in a row. Does this affect the probability of getting heads on the next flip? 
Even though we may feel like it’s time to see “tails”, it is impossible for a past coin flip to impact a future one. 
The fact that previous coin flips do not affect future ones is called independence. Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.

Are there cases where previous events DO affect the outcome of the next event? Suppose we have a bag of five marbles: two marbles are blue and three marbles are red. 
If we take one marble out of the bag, what is the probability that the second marble we take out is blue?

A diagram of the possible outcomes of pulling two marbles out of a bag when pulling them out without replacement.

This describes two events that are dependent. The probability of grabbing a blue marble in the second event depends on whether we take out a red or a blue marble in the first event.

What if we had put back the first marble? Is the probability that we pick a blue marble second independent or dependent on what we pick out first? 
In this case, the events would be independent.

Why do we care if events are independent or dependent? Knowing this helps us quantify the probability of events that depend on preexisting knowledge. 
This helps researchers understand and predict complex processes such as:

Effectiveness of vaccines
The weather on a particular day
Betting odds for professional sports games
We will explore applications of this further in the lesson!



Mutually Exclusive Events
Two events are considered mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. 
For example, consider a single coin flip: the events “tails” and “heads” are mutually exclusive because we cannot get both tails and heads on a single flip.

We can visualize two mutually exclusive events as a pair of non-overlapping circles. 
They do not overlap because there is no outcome for one event that is also in the sample space for the other:

A Venn diagram that shows two non-overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. 
Nothing is shaded in the Venn diagram.

What about events that are not mutually exclusive? 
If event A is rolling an odd number and event B is rolling a number greater than two, these events are not mutually exclusive. 
They have an intersection of {3, 5}. Any events that have a non-empty intersection are not mutually exclusive.



Addition Rule
Now, it’s time to apply these concepts to calculate probabilities.

Let’s go back to one of our first examples: event A is rolling an odd number on a six-sided die and event B is rolling a number greater than two. What if we want to find the probability of one or both events occurring? This is the probability of the union of A and B:


P(A or B)
We can visualize this calculation as follows:

This gif shows three sequential images of a Venn diagram that outline the formula for P(A or B). In the Venn Diagram, there are two overlapping circles: one that corresponds to event A and one that corresponds to event B. In the first image, the event A circle is shaded blue and P(A) is added to the formula. In the second image, the event B circle is shaded red and the formula now shows P(A) + P(B). In the final image, the overlap of event A and event B is shaded green and the formula now shows P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

This animation gives a visual representation of the addition rule formula, which is:

P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A and B)
We subtract the intersection of events A and B because it is included twice in the addition of P(A) and P(B).

What if the events are mutually exclusive? On a single die roll, 
if event A is that the roll is less than or equal to 2 and event B is that the roll is greater than or equal to 5, then events A and B cannot both happen.

This gif shows two sequential images of a Venn diagram that outline the formula for P(A or B) for independent events. 
In the Venn Diagram, there are two non-overlapping circles: one that corresponds to event A and one that corresponds to event B. 
In the first image, the event A circle is shaded blue and P(A) is added to the formula. 
In the second image, the event B circle is shaded red and the final formula now shows P(A) + P(B).

For mutually exclusive events, the addition rule formula is:

P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)
This is because the intersection is empty, so we don’t need to remove any overlap between the two events.

Code: 
def prob_a_or_b(a, b, all_possible_outcomes):
  # probability of event a
  prob_a = len(a)/len(all_possible_outcomes)
	
	# probability of event b
  prob_b = len(b)/len(all_possible_outcomes)
	
	# intersection of events a and b
  inter = a.intersection(b)
	
	# probability of intersection of events a and b
  prob_inter = len(inter)/len(all_possible_outcomes)
	
	# add return statement here
  return prob_a + prob_b - prob_inter

# rolling a die once and getting an even number or an odd number
evens = {2, 4, 6}
odds = {1, 3, 5}
all_possible_rolls = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# call function here first
print(prob_a_or_b(evens, odds, all_possible_rolls))

# rolling a die once and getting an odd number or a number greater than 2
odds = {1, 3, 5}
greater_than_two = {3, 4, 5, 6}
all_possible_rolls = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# call function here second

# call function here third
print(prob_a_or_b(diamond_cards, face_cards, all_possible_cards))



Conditional Probability
If we want to calculate the probability that a pair of dependent events both occur, we need to define conditional probability. Using a bag of marbles as an example, let’s remind ourselves of the definition of dependent events:

A diagram of the possible outcomes of pulling two marbles out of a bag when pulling them out without replacement.

If we pick two marbles from a bag of five marbles without replacement, the probability that the second marble is red depends on the color of the first marble. We have a special name for this: conditional probability. In short, conditional probability measures the probability of one event occurring, given that another one has already occurred.

Notationally, we denote the word “given” with a vertical line. For example, if we want to represent the probability that we choose a red marble given the first marble is blue, we can write:

P(Red Second∣Blue First)
From the above diagram, we know that:

P(Red Second∣Blue First)= 3/4
​
 
What if we picked out two marbles with replacement? What does the conditional probability look like? Well, let’s think about this. Regardless of which marble we pick out first, it will be put back into the bag. Therefore, the probability of picking out a red marble or a blue marble second is unaffected by the first outcome.

Therefore, for independent events, we can say the following:

P(A∣B)=P(A)
and
P(B∣A)=P(B)
​


Multiplication Rule
We have looked at the addition rule, which describes the probability one event OR another event (or both) occurs. What if we want to calculate the probability that two events happen simultaneously? For two events, A and B, this is P(A and B) or the probability of the intersection of A and B.

General Formula
The general formula for the probability that two events occur simultaneously is:

P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A)
However, for independent events, we can simplify this formula slightly.

Dependent Events
Let’s go back to our bag of marbles example. We have five marbles: two are blue, and three are red. We pick two marbles without replacement. What if we want to know the probability of choosing a blue marble first AND a blue marble second?

Taking conditional probability into account, the multiplication rule for these two dependent events is:


P(Blue 1st and Blue 2nd)=P(Blue 1st)⋅P(Blue 2nd∣Blue 1st)
P(Blue 1st and Blue 2nd)= 2/5 ⋅ 1/4
​
 
P(Blue 1st and Blue 2nd)= 1/10
​
This is one potential outcome when picking two marbles out of the bag. One way to visualize all possible outcomes of a pair of events is a tree diagram.

Tree diagrams have the following properties:

Each branch represents a specific set of events.
The probabilities the terminal branches (all possible sets of outcomes) sum to one.
We multiply across branches (using the multiplication rule!) to calculate the probability that each branch (set of outcomes) will occur.
In the browser to the right, you will be able to play with one!

Independent Events
For two independent events, the multiplication rule becomes less complicated. The probability of two independent events occurring is:

P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B)
This is because the following is true for independent events:

P(B∣A)=P(B)
Let’s look at the simplest example: flipping a fair coin twice. Event A is that we get tails on the first flip, and event B is that we get tails on the second flip. P(A) = P(B) = 0.5, so according to our formula, the probability of getting tails on both flips would be:


P(A and B) = 0.5⋅0.5 = 0.25
Visually on a tree diagram, we see:This visual shows a tree diagram that outlines all possible outcomes of flipping a fair coin two times.

Conditional Probability Continued
We have introduced conditional probability as a part of the multiplication rule for dependent events. However, let’s go a bit more in-depth with it as it is a powerful probability tool that has real-world applications.

For this problem, we will follow along the tree diagram on the right.

Suppose that the following is true (this is shown in the first set of branches in the diagram):

20 percent of the population has strep throat.
80 percent of the population does not have strep throat.
Now suppose that we test a bunch of people for strep throat. The possible results of these tests are shown in the next set of branches:

If a person has strep throat, there is an 85% chance their test will be positive and a 15% chance it will be negative. This is labeled as:
P(+∣ST)=0.85
and
P(−∣ST)=0.15
​
 
If a person does not have strep throat, there is a 98% chance their test will be negative and a 2% chance it will be positive. This can be labeled as:
P(−∣NO ST)=0.98
and
P(+∣NO ST)=0.02
​
 
Finally, let’s look at the four possible pairs of outcomes that form the terminal branches of our diagram:
P(ST and +)=0.17
P(ST and -)=0.03
P(NO ST and +)=0.016
P(NO ST and -)=0.784
​
 
Together, these add up to one since they capture all potential outcomes after patients are tested.

It’s great that we have all this information. However, we are missing something. If someone gets a positive result, what is the probability that they have strep throat? Notationally, we can write this probability as:

P(ST∣+)
In the next exercise, we’ll explore how we can use our tree diagram to calculate this probability.
