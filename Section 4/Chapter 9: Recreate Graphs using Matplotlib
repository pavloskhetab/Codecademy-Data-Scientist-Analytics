Project Introduction
Letâ€™s imagine that you are working as a high school math teacher. 
You want to display important metrics about your current class and the ones you have taught in previous years, 
in order to understand patterns and trends that may not be visible from just seeing the numbers in a spreadsheet.

In this project, you will examine some graphs that we have created, and then you will recreate them using Matplotlib. 
This will give you a chance to practice with the plot types and properties we explored in Lesson 2.

Code:
import codecademylib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

past_years_averages = [82, 84, 83, 86, 74, 84, 90]
years = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006]
error = [1.5, 2.1, 1.2, 3.2, 2.3, 1.7, 2.4]

# Make your chart here
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plt.bar(range(len(past_years_averages)), past_years_averages, yerr = error, capsize=5)
plt.axis([-0.5, 6.5, 70, 95])

ax = plt.subplot()
ax.set_xticks(range(len(years)))
ax.set_xticklabels(years)

plt.title('Final Exam Averages')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Test Average')

plt.savefig('my_bar_chart.png')

plt.show()
