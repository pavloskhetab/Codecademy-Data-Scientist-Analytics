Project Introduction
Letâ€™s imagine that you are working as a high school math teacher. 
You want to display important metrics about your current class and the ones you have taught in previous years, 
in order to understand patterns and trends that may not be visible from just seeing the numbers in a spreadsheet.

In this project, you will examine some graphs that we have created, and then you will recreate them using Matplotlib. 
This will give you a chance to practice with the plot types and properties we explored in Lesson 2.


Bar Chart with Error
12 min
First, we are going to look at the chart called bar_chart.png.

bar_chart

The data you will need to recreate this chart is in the

lists
 past_years_averages, years, and error.

Save your recreated chart to a file called my_bar_chart.png.

Code:
import codecademylib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

past_years_averages = [82, 84, 83, 86, 74, 84, 90]
years = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006]
error = [1.5, 2.1, 1.2, 3.2, 2.3, 1.7, 2.4]

# Make your chart here
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
plt.bar(range(len(past_years_averages)), past_years_averages, yerr = error, capsize=5)
plt.axis([-0.5, 6.5, 70, 95])

ax = plt.subplot()
ax.set_xticks(range(len(years)))
ax.set_xticklabels(years)

plt.title('Final Exam Averages')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Test Average')

plt.savefig('my_bar_chart.png')

plt.show()



Side By Side Bars
18 min
Now, we are going to look at the chart called side-by-side.png. 
This displays the differences in average test scores between students who went to two different middle schools before enrolling in your high school.

    return [t*x + w*n for x in range(d)]

# Make your chart here
school_a_x = create_x(2, 0.8, 1, 5)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))

ax = plt.subplot()

plt.bar(school_a_x, middle_school_a)
plt.bar(school_b_x, middle_school_b)

middle_x = [ (a + b) / 2.0 for a, b in zip(school_a_x, school_b_x)]

ax.set_xticks(middle_x)
ax.set_xticklabels(unit_topics)

# x-axis limits for a specific subplot
ax.set_xlim(0, 10)

# y-axis limits for a specific subplot
ax.set_ylim(70, 90)

plt.legend(['Middle School A', 'Middle School B'])
plt.title('Test Averages on Different Units')
plt.ylabel('test average')
plt.xlabel('unit')

plt.show()

plt.savefig('my_side_by_side.png')



Stacked Bars
14 min
Now, we are going to look at the chart called stacked-bars.png. This graph displays the breakdown of students who got As, Bs, Cs, Ds, and Fs in each unit.

c_bottom = np.add(As, Bs)

#create d_bottom and f_bottom here
d_bottom = np.add(c_bottom, Cs)

f_bottom = np.add(d_bottom, Ds)

#create your plot here
plt.figure(figsize = (10,8))
plt.bar(x, As)
plt.bar(x, Bs, bottom=As)
