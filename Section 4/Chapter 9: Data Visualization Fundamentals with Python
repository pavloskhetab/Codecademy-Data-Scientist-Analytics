Line Graphs in Matplotlib

Introduction
Matplotlib is a Python library used to create charts and graphs.

In this first lesson, you will get an overview of the basic commands necessary to build and label a line graph. 
The concepts you will learn include:

Creating a line graph from data
Changing the appearance of the line
Zooming in on different parts of the axis
Putting labels on titles and axes
Creating a more complex figure layout
Adding legends to graphs
Changing tick labels and positions
Saving what you’ve made
By the end of the lesson, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a master at presenting and organizing your data in Python.

To the right, you can see an example of the kind of chart you’ll be able to make by the end of this lesson!



Basic Line Plot
Line graphs are helpful for visualizing how a variable changes over time.

Some possible data that would be displayed with a line graph:

average prices of gasoline over the past decade
weight of an individual over the past couple of months
average temperature along a line of longitude over different latitudes

Using Matplotlib methods, the following code will create a simple line graph using .plot() and display it using .show() :

x_values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
y_values = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)
plt.show()

x_values is a variable holding a list of x-values for each point on our line graph
y_values is a variable holding a list of y-values for each point on our line graph
plt is the name we have given to the Matplotlib module we have imported at the top of the code
plt.plot(x_values, y_values) will create the line graph
plt.show() will actually display the graph
Our graph would look like this:


Let’s get some practice with plotting lines.

Code:
