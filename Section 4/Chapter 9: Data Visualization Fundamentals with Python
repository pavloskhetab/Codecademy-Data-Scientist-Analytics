Line Graphs in Matplotlib

Introduction
Matplotlib is a Python library used to create charts and graphs.

In this first lesson, you will get an overview of the basic commands necessary to build and label a line graph. The concepts you will learn include:

Creating a line graph from data
Changing the appearance of the line
Zooming in on different parts of the axis
Putting labels on titles and axes
Creating a more complex figure layout
Adding legends to graphs
Changing tick labels and positions
Saving what you’ve made
By the end of the lesson, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a master at presenting and organizing your data in Python.

To the right, you can see an example of the kind of chart you’ll be able to make by the end of this lesson!
