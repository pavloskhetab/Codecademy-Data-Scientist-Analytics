Associations: Quantitative and Categorical Variables

Introduction
Examining the relationship between variables can give us key insight into our data. 
In this lesson, we will cover ways of assessing the association between a quantitative variable 
and a categorical variable.

In the next few exercises, we’ll explore a dataset that contains the following information about 
students at two portuguese schools:

school: the school each student attends, Gabriel Periera ('GP') or Mousinho da Silveria ('MS')
address: the location of the student’s home ('U' for urban and 'R' for rural)
absences: the number of times the student was absent during the school year
Mjob: the student’s mother’s job industry
Fjob: the student’s father’s job industry
G3: the student’s score on a math assessment, ranging from 0 to 20
Suppose we want to know: Is a student’s score (G3) associated with their school (school)? 
If so, then knowing what school a student attends gives us information about what their score is likely to be. 
For example, maybe students at one of the schools consistently score higher than students at the other school.

To start answering this question, it is useful to save scores from each school in two separate lists:

scores_GP = students.G3[students.school == 'GP']
scores_MS = students.G3[students.school == 'MS']

Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import codecademylib3

students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')

#print the first five rows of students:
print(students.head())

#separate out scores for students who live in urban and rural locations:
scores_urban = students.G3[students.address == 'U']

scores_rural = students.G3[students.address == 'R']



Mean and Median Differences
Recall that in the last exercise, we began investigating whether or not there is an association between math 
scores and the school a student attends. We can begin quantifying this association by using 
two common summary statistics, mean and median differences. 
To calculate the difference in mean G3 scores for the two schools, 
we can start by finding the mean math score for students at each school. 
We can then find the difference between them:

mean_GP = np.mean(scores_GP)
mean_MS = np.mean(scores_MS)
print(mean_GP) #output: 10.49
print(mean_MS) #output: 9.85
print(mean_GP - mean_MS) #Output: 0.64

We see that the mean math score for students at GP is 10.49, while the mean score for students at MS is 9.85. 
The mean difference is 0.64. We can follow a similar process to calculate a median difference:

median_GP = np.median(scores_GP)
median_MS = np.median(scores_MS)
print(median_GP) #Output: 11.0
print(median_MS) #Output: 10.0
print(median_GP-median_MS) #Output: 1.0

GP students also have a higher median score, by one point. Highly associated variables tend to have 
a large mean or median difference. Since “large” could have different meanings depending on the variable, 
we will go into more detail in the next exercise.

Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')

scores_urban = students.G3[students.address == 'U']
scores_rural = students.G3[students.address == 'R']

#calculate means for each group:
scores_urban_mean = np.mean(scores_urban)
scores_rural_mean = np.mean(scores_rural)

#print mean scores:
print('Mean score - students w/ urban address:')
print(scores_urban_mean)
print('Mean score - students w/ rural address:')
print(scores_rural_mean)

#calculate mean difference:
mean_diff = scores_urban_mean - scores_rural_mean

#print mean difference
print('Mean difference:')
print(mean_diff)

#calculate medians for each group:
scores_urban_median = np.median(scores_urban)
scores_rural_median = np.median(scores_rural)

#print median scores
print('Median score - students w/ urban address:')
print(scores_urban_median)
print('Median score - students w/ rural address:')
print(scores_rural_median)

#calculate median difference
median_diff = scores_urban_median - scores_rural_median

#print median difference
print('Median difference:')
print(median_diff)



Side-by-Side Box Plots
The difference in mean math scores for students at GP and MS was 0.64.
How do we know whether this difference is considered small or large? To answer this question, 
we need to know something about the spread of the data.

One way to get a better sense of spread is by looking at a visual representation of the data. 
Side-by-side box plots are useful in visualizing mean and median differences because they allow us to 
visually estimate the variation in the data. This can help us determine if mean or median differences are 
“large” or “small”.

Let’s take a look at side by side boxplots of math scores at each school:

sns.boxplot(data = df, x = 'school', y = 'G3')
plt.show()

Looking at the plot, we can clearly see that there is a lot of overlap between the boxes (i.e. the middle 50% of 
the data). Therefore, we can be more confident that there is not much difference between the math scores 
of the two groups.

In contrast, suppose we saw the following plot:

In this version, the boxes barely overlap, demonstrating that the middle 50% of scores are different 
for the two schools. This would be evidence of a stronger association between school and math score.

Code:
import pandas as pd
import codecademylib3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns

students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')

#create the boxplot here:
sns.boxplot(data = students, x = 'address', y = 'G3')

plt.show()
