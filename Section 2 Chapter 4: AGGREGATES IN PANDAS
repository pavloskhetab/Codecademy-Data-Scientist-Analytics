AGGREGATES IN PANDAS
Introduction
In this lesson, you will learn about aggregates in Pandas. 
An aggregate statistic is a way of creating a single number that describes a group of numbers. 
Common aggregate statistics include mean, median, and standard deviation.

You will also learn how to rearrange a DataFrame into a pivot table, which is a great way to compare data across two dimensions.



Calculating Column Statistics
Aggregate functions summarize many data points (i.e., a column of a dataframe) into a smaller set of values.

Some examples of this type of calculation include:

The DataFrame customers contains the names and ages of all of your customers. You want to find the median age:
print(customers.age)
>> [23, 25, 31, 35, 35, 46, 62]
print(customers.age.median())
>> 35

The DataFrame shipments contains address information for all shipments that youâ€™ve sent out in the past year. 
You want to know how many different states you have shipped to (and how many shipments went to the same state).
print(shipments.state)
>> ['CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'NY', 'NY', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ']
print(shipments.state.nunique())
>> 3

The DataFrame inventory contains a list of types of t-shirts that your company makes. You want a list of the colors that your shirts come in.
print(inventory.color)
>> ['blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'green', 'green', 'orange', 'orange', 'orange']
print(inventory.color.unique())
>> ['blue', 'green', 'orange']

The general syntax for these calculations is:

df.column_name.command()

The following table summarizes some common commands:

Command	Description
mean	Average of all values in column
std	Standard deviation
median	Median
max	Maximum value in column
min	Minimum value in column
count	Number of values in column
nunique	Number of unique values in column
unique	List of unique values in column

Code:
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')
print(orders.head(10))

most_expensive = orders.price.max()

num_colors = orders.shoe_color.nunique()

print(num_colors)
