Central Tendency for Quantitative Data
For quantitative variables, we often want to describe the central tendency, or 
the “typical” value of a variable. For example, what is the typical cost of rent in New York City?

There are several common measures of central tendency:

Mean: The average value of the variable, calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
Median: The middle value of the variable when sorted.
Mode: The most frequent value of the variable.
Trimmed mean: The mean excluding x percent of the lowest and highest data points.
For our rentals DataFrame with a column named rent that contains rental prices, 
we can calculate the central tendency statistics listed above as follows:

# Mean
rentals.rent.mean()

# Median
rentals.rent.median()

# Mode
rentals.rent.mode()

# Trimmed mean
from scipy.stats import trim_mean
trim_mean(rentals.rent, proportiontocut=0.1)  # trim extreme 10%

Code:
import pandas as pd

movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Save the mean to mean_budget
mean_budget = movies.production_budget.mean()

print(mean_budget)

# Save the median to med_budget
med_budget = movies.production_budget.median()

print(med_budget)

# Save the mode to mode_budget
mode_budget = movies.production_budget.mode()

print(mode_budget)

# Save the trimmed mean to trmean_budget
from scipy.stats import trim_mean
trmean_budget = trim_mean(movies.production_budget, proportiontocut = 0.2)

print(trmean_budget)



Spread for Quantitative Data
The spread of a quantitative variable describes the amount of variability. This is important because it provides context for measures of central tendency. For example, if there is a lot of variability in New York City rent prices, we can be less certain that the mean or median price is representative of what the typical rent is.

There are several common measures of spread:

Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of a variable.
Interquartile range (IQR): The difference between the 75th and 25th percentile values.
Variance: The average of the squared distance from each data point to the mean.
Standard deviation (SD): The square root of the variance.
Mean absolute deviation (MAD): The mean absolute value of the distance between each data point and the mean.
For our rentals DataFrame, we can calculate the spread for the rent column as follows:

# Range
rentals.rent.max() - rentals.rent.min()

# Interquartile range
rentals.rent.quantile(0.75) - rentals.rent.quantile(0.25)

from scipy.stats import iqr
iqr(rentals.rent)  # alternative way

# Variance
rentals.rent.var()

# Standard deviation
rentals.rent.std()

# Mean absolute deviation
rentals.rent.mad()
