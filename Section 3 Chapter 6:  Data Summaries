Central Tendency for Quantitative Data
For quantitative variables, we often want to describe the central tendency, or 
the “typical” value of a variable. For example, what is the typical cost of rent in New York City?

There are several common measures of central tendency:

Mean: The average value of the variable, calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
Median: The middle value of the variable when sorted.
Mode: The most frequent value of the variable.
Trimmed mean: The mean excluding x percent of the lowest and highest data points.
For our rentals DataFrame with a column named rent that contains rental prices, 
we can calculate the central tendency statistics listed above as follows:

# Mean
rentals.rent.mean()

# Median
rentals.rent.median()

# Mode
rentals.rent.mode()

# Trimmed mean
from scipy.stats import trim_mean
trim_mean(rentals.rent, proportiontocut=0.1)  # trim extreme 10%

Code:
import pandas as pd

movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Save the mean to mean_budget
mean_budget = movies.production_budget.mean()

print(mean_budget)

# Save the median to med_budget
med_budget = movies.production_budget.median()

print(med_budget)

# Save the mode to mode_budget
mode_budget = movies.production_budget.mode()

print(mode_budget)

# Save the trimmed mean to trmean_budget
from scipy.stats import trim_mean
trmean_budget = trim_mean(movies.production_budget, proportiontocut = 0.2)

print(trmean_budget)
