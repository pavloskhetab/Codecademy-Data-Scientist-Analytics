Lyft Trip Data
Let’s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

trips: trips information
riders: user data
cars: autonomous cars
Have fun!

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Write the following queries:
1.Let’s examine the three tables.

SELECT * FROM trips;
 
SELECT * FROM riders;
 
SELECT * FROM cars;
What are the column names?


2.What’s the primary key of trips?

What’s the primary key of riders?

What’s the primary key of cars?


3.Try out a simple cross join between riders and cars.

Is the result useful?


4.Suppose we want to create a Trip Log with the trips and its users.

Find the columns to join between trips and riders and combine the two tables using a LEFT JOIN.

Let trips be the left table.


5.Suppose we want to create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips.

Find the columns to join on and combine the trips and cars table using an INNER JOIN.


6.The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month.

Stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2.


Bonus: Queries and Aggregates
7.What is the average cost for a trip?


8.Lyft is looking to do an email campaign for all the irregular users.

Find all the riders who have used Lyft less than 500 times!


9.Calculate the number of cars that are active.


10.It’s safety recall time for cars that have been on the road for a while.

Write a query that finds the two cars that have the highest trips_completed.

Code:
SELECT *
FROM trips;

SELECT * 
FROM riders;

SELECT *
FROM cars;

SELECT *
FROM riders
CROSS JOIN cars;

SELECT trips.date, 
   trips.pickup, 
   trips.dropoff, 
   trips.type, 
   trips.cost,
   riders.first, 
   riders.last,
   riders.username
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.id = riders.id;

SELECT trips.date,
  trips.pickup,
  trips.dropoff,
  trips.type,
  trips.cost, 
  cars.model,
  cars.OS,
  cars.status,
  cars.trips_completed
FROM trips
JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

SELECT *
FROM riders
UNION
SELECT * 
FROM riders2;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2)
FROM trips;

WITH total_riders AS (
  SELECT * FROM riders
  UNION
  SELECT * FROM riders2
)
SELECT * FROM total_riders
WHERE total_trips < 500;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active';

SELECT *
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC
LIMIT 2;
