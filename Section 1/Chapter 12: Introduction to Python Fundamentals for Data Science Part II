Welcome to Python Fundamentals for Data Science Part II
Take your Python skills to the next level with everything you will learn in Part II!

Welcome back!

Now that you have some familiarity and fluency with Python, we are going to dive into some more applied applications. 
But first, we want to show you some of the very cool things that you can do with Python.

What will Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part II) cover?
After this unit, you will be able to:

Get data from an API (initially, this may seem out of place, but you will soon see how Python makes getting data much easier)
Simulate a dataset
Manipulate strings in Python
Map data using Python dictionaries
Work with modules and files
Build Python projects that tackle real data
Create a Portfolio project to show off your work!
Why did we build this?
By the end of this Unit, you will have enough fluency with Python that you’ll be ready to apply your programming skills to solving real data problems.

What else should I know about this course?
We’ve created a lot of review content to help you hone your Python programming skills. 
In order to focus on building and practicing the most essential skills to reach your goal, that content is not in this path. 
However, we encourage you to practice your Python skills with our Code Challenges page.

Who are my classmates?
Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. 
Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and 
providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
