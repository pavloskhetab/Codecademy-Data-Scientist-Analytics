Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project
Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a person’s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.

Note: while insurance companies do use BMI in their calculations, and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.

Setup Instructions

Setting up Factors
1.Our first step is to create the variables for each factor we will consider when estimating medical insurance costs.

These are the variables we will need to create:

age: age of the individual in years
sex: 0 for female, 1 for male*
bmi: individual’s body mass index
num_of_children: number of children the individual has
smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
At the top of script.py, create the following variables for a 28-year-old, nonsmoking woman who has three children and a BMI of 26.2.

Notes:
While insurance companies do use BMI in their calculations, and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.
We are using this medical insurance dataset as a guide, which unfortunately does not include data for non-binary individuals.


Working with the Formula
2.After the declaration of the variables, create a variable called insurance_cost that utilizes the following formula:

insurance_cost=250∗age−128∗sex
+370∗bmi+425∗num_of_children
+24000∗smoker−12500

 

3.Let’s display this value in an informative way. Print out the following string in the terminal:

This person's insurance cost is {insurance_cost} dollars.
You will need to use string concatenation, including the str() function to print out the insurance_cost.


Looking at Age Factor
4.We have seen how our formula can estimate costs for one individual. Now let’s play with some individual factors to see what role each one plays in our estimation!

Let’s start with the age factor. Using a plus-equal operator, add 4 years to our age variable.


5.Now that we have changed our age value, we want to recalculate our insurance cost. Declare a new variable called new_insurance_cost underneath the expression that increased age by 4.

Make sure you leave the line with the insurance_cost variable the same. We will use it later in our program!


6.Next, we want to find the difference between our new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost. To do this, let’s create a new variable called change_in_insurance_cost and set it equal to the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost.

Note: depending on the order that we subtract (eg., new_insurance_cost - insurance cost vs. insurance_cost - new_insurance_cost), we’ll get a positive or negative version of the same number. To make this difference interpretable, let’s calculate new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost. Then we can say, “people who are four years older have estimated insurance costs that are change_in_insurance_cost dollars different,” where the sign of change_in_insurance_cost tells us whether the cost is higher or lower.


7.We want to display this information in an informative way similar to the output from instruction 3. On the next line, print the following string in the terminal, where XXX is replaced by the value of change_in_insurance_cost:

The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is XXX dollars.
Doing this will tell us how 4 years in age affects medical insurance cost estimates assuming that all other variables remain the same.

You will need to concatenate strings and use the str() method.


Looking at BMI Factor
8.Now that you have looked at the age factor, let’s move onto another one: BMI. First, we have to redefine our age variable to be its original value.

Set age to 28 following your last piece of code. This will reset its value and allow us to focus on just the change in the BMI factor moving forward.

On the next line, using the plus-equal operator, add 3.1 to our bmi variable.


9.Now let’s find out how a change in BMI affects insurance costs. Our next steps are pretty much the same as we have done before when looking at age.

Below the line where bmi was increased by 3.1, rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost

Display the following string in the output terminal, where XXX is replaced by the value of change_in_insurance_cost:

The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is XXX dollars.
You can leave the code above it as is, including the print statements.


Looking at Male vs. Female Factor
10.Let’s look at the effect sex has on medical insurance costs. Before we make any additional changes, first reassign your bmi variable back to its original value of 26.2.

On a new line of code, reassign the value of sex to 1. A reminder that 1 identifies male individuals and 0 identifies female individuals.


11.Perform the steps below!

Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost.

Display the following string in the output terminal, where XXX is replaced by the value of change_in_insurance_cost:

The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is XXX dollars.

12.Notice that this time you got a negative value for change_in_insurance_cost. Let’s think about what this means. We changed the sex variable from 0 (female) to 1 (male) and it decreased the estimated insurance costs.

This means that men tend to have lower medical costs on average than women. Reflect on the other findings you have dug up from this investigation so far.

Extra Practice
13.Great job on the project!!!

So far we have looked at 3 of the 5 factors in the insurance costs formula. The two remaining are smoker and num_of_children. If you want to keep challenging yourself, spend some time investigating these factors!

Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost

Display the information in the terminal!


Code:
# create the initial variables below
age = 28
sex = 0
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0


# Add insurance estimate formula below
insurance_cost = (250 * age) - (128 * sex) + (370 * bmi) + (425 * num_of_children) + (24000 * smoker) - 12500

#print(f"This person's insurance is {insurance_cost} dollars.")

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Age Factor
age += 4
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# BMI Factor
age = 28
bmi += 3.1
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMY by 3.1 is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Male vs. Female Factor
BMI = 26.2
sex = 1
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Extra Practice

# Smoker Factor
sex = 0
smoker = 1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for being a smoker instead of a non-smoker is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Children Factor
smoker = 0
num_of_children = 0

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for being childless is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
